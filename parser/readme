To execute and test the parser, we have 3 steps:

 1. Creation:
	To create the required files you can type: 
		make create
		
 2. Test
	To test the scanner with some input files, you can type: 
		make test filename=["test0.txt"|"test1.txt"|"test2.txt"|"test3.txt"|"test4.txt"]
		e.g. make test filename="test2.txt"
	Each of the five test files are in the testfiles directory. 
	After executing this instruction, the program will print the scanner results for each file
	
 3. Cleaning
	Finally, if you want to erase the created files in step 1, you can type:
		make clean
